Assessment of GNSS Raw Measurements Based on GNSS Logger at Low Latitudes Stations

Description: Many positioning and navigation systems cannot provide accurate results in remote areas due to high ionospheric error. To overcome
this, we have used GNSS raw measurements for accurate positioning. We collect GNSS raw measurement data from the International Global
Navigation Satellite Systems (IGS) and the GNSS Logger App using an Android mobile in RINEX format. We calculate pseudo ranges between the
user receiver and the satellite, and by using L1or L2 frequency, position, velocity, and time. Deriving ASCII files from RINEX records using GPS-
TEC, Seemala 2004 software generates graphs, and finally by using MATLAB code to forecast position correction.
